      <h1>Hiking in Olympic National Park</h1>
      <h2> By Micah Usher</h2>
      <main>
      <article>One of the places I like the most is out in the wilderness of the great North West.
         Nothing beats the feeling of driving into the mountains with an adventure ahead.

         <p>This particular trip, I was going to hike along the Sol Duc, around the Seven Lakes Basin Loop for three days, then drive to the coast and hike along the beach from Second Beach to Oil City.</p>
         <p>Things don't always go as planned.</p>

         </figure>
         <p>Getting this far was already a 5 hour flight, a stay in Seattle, taking a train to Tacoma, and then a 3 hour drive to this city, 
            with another one hour drive ahead to the trailhead, we needed a rest to make sure we were packed and fresh for whatever happens on the trails ahead.</p>
            <p>Is it bears? Probably.</p>

            <p>I think maybe instead of just give a linear recap of this hike, I should focus on WHY I love this park.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>1. There's nothing quite as feeling connected to the world around me as being in wilderness</li>
              <li> 2. There is nothing as humbling as walking into a bear on the path, or realizing you have to crawl around a narrow path to make it and realizing you are at the mercy of the elements of this world.</li>
              <li> 3. It's easy to get lost in day to day life and forget how much beauty there is just outside of our doorstep and beyond our noses. 4. Our society tends to focus on the self, and there, along a mountain ridge, by a coast, or sitting under a night sky, there is no focus on the self (aside from how to make dinner)
            </li> <li>4. It's a ridiculously beautiful park</li>
         </ul>
