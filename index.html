      <h1>Hiking in Olympic National Park</h1>
      <h2> By Micah Usher</h2>
      <main>
      <article>One of the places I like the most is out in the wilderness of the great North West.
         Nothing beats the feeling of driving into the mountains with an adventure ahead.

            <figcaption><b>I took this crossing over a bridge with the mountains in the distance</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>This particular trip, I was going to hike along the Sol Duc, around the Seven Lakes Basin Loop for three days, then drive to the coast and hike along the beach from Second Beach to Oil City.</p>
         <p>Things don't always go as planned.</p>
         <br>

         </figure>
         <p>Getting this far was already a 5 hour flight, a stay in Seattle, taking a train to Tacoma, and then a 3 hour drive to this city, 
            with another one hour drive ahead to the trailhead, we needed a rest to make sure we were packed and fresh for whatever happens on the trails ahead.</p>
            <p>Is it bears? Probably.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I think maybe instead of just giving a linear recap of this hike, I should also say WHY I love this park before continuing.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>1. There's nothing quite as feeling connected to the world around me as being in wilderness</li>
              <li> 2. There is nothing as humbling as walking into a bear on the path, or realizing you have to crawl around a narrow path to make it and realizing you are at the mercy of the elements of this world.</li>
              <li> 3. It's easy to get lost in day to day life and forget how much beauty there is just outside of our doorstep and beyond our noses. 4. Our society tends to focus on the self, and there, along a mountain ridge, by a coast, or sitting under a night sky, there is no focus on the self (aside from how to make dinner)
            </li> <li>4. It's a ridiculously beautiful park, with everything from beaches to mountains and even glaciers</li>
         </ul>

         <p>There is nothing like disconnecting from city life, social media, and the day to day doldrum. Sitting by a lake in the mountains at sunset leaves a lot of space to wonder at the beauty of it all and just think.</p>

         <p>I am not a morning person, but it's hard not to wake up at the break of dawn in the woods, especially when there is a beach to hike to that day. This leg we began at 5:30am. We had to just to be able to make it to our next camp by sundown, but also because to make it to that camp we had to hike through areas that are not flooded by tides for a couple of hours every day.</p>

         </figure>
         <p>But first before the beach, we had to crawl over these rocks on top of a mountain. Yes, this IS the trail. Doing this at 6:30am with no coffee doesn't really matter because clmibing over these rocks, and jumping from boulder to boulder with a 30 pound pack on will make you more alert than any cup of joe.</p>

         </figure>
         <p>Walking around a mountainous path, with nowhere to go but back or forward I walked right into this bear on the path. We looked at each other, and I realized I just had to wait it out. After about 20 minutes of just sitting here and the bear showed no signs of moving, I had to start yelling because otherwise I would have been here for who knows how long. The bear ran up the hill, and I continued on hiking.</p>

         </figure>
         <p>there are moments in hiking where you reach a state of zen. Through tiredness, being sore in all the places, seeing so many beautiful sights and then moments of accomplishment when hiking out of the woods into views like this. It doesn't matter if you're tired, or sore or hungry, you just reach a point of moving forward.</p>

            <figcaption><b>There is still a lot of climbing and hiking to do around the beach to get to our camp</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Hiking along a beach in a tidal zone also means a lot of climbing, so if a point is under water, you have to go up and through the woods and over. Sore hands, bloody shins, evenn if you want to get somewhere you have to take your time and stay safe. Sometimes that means climbing down slowly. This was actually a pretty long steep climb, even if it doesn't look too bad in the photo.</p>

         <p>We made it back out to the beach, but still had another hour to go before reaching camp. That means climbing and hiking through woods in near dark. No matter, i don;t know if I will ever be here again so the best time to take a picture is now.</p>

         <p>One thing about being out in the wilderness is there is so much life. At breakfast, a family a sea otters ran by our camp. Apparently their home was in our water source. The next best water source we found later that day was about a mile away, a little water fall on the side of a bluff.</p>

         <p>Later, we grabbed our packs to go hike to some other tidal pools and find a better water source than a rusty brown stream that had sea otters in it. This was Heather's first time being at the Pacific ocean, so of course she had to run in it.</p>

         <p>Apparently along the coast here the mornings are cloudy and rainy, but the afternoons are sunny and warm. The ocean carves trees out with water, which is a reminder of how powerful it is, but it also makes calm spaces for sitting and enjoying it's beauty. It is also high tide right now so we can't really hike anywhere, so we lunch and nap and get sunburnt</p>

         <p>A low tide again means I can grab my camera and go photograph the sunset with the tidal pools. There is no terror like the thought of falling into a pool with a camera, but the risk for capturing this memory is worth it.</p>

         <p>We had originally planned to hike through, but at this meeting by the campfire under the stars at the break of sunset we decided to stay another day on the beach at the same campsite. Nobody was camping here anyways, and we are here to enjoy the views. Why leave the best one? Also, when we were driving into the park I got a call from the ranger warning me the second leg of this hike was in really bad condition adn I would likely need a machete to get through the undergrowth. We didn't bring one, so we had another day at the beach. If there is one thing that I know, it is to know when to take a break when the world gives you the opportunity, and to stop, appreciate where you are - and if you're lucky, that break also happens to be on a beach in the middle of the wilderness. </p>
