      <h1>Hiking in Olympic National Park</h1>
      <h2> By Micah Usher</h2>
      <main> 
      <article>One of the places I like the most is out in the wilderness of the great North West.
         Nothing beats the feeling of driving into the mountains with an adventure ahead.
         <figure>

            <figcaption><b>I took this crossing over a bridge with the mountains in the distance</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>This particular trip, I was going to hike along the Sol Duc, around the Seven Lakes Basin Loop for three days, then drive to the coast and hike along the beach from Second Beach to Oil City.</p>
         <p>Things don't always go as planned.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\2 Port Angeles Stop.jpg" alt="Stopping for a rest before the hike" style= "width:50%">
            <figcaption><b>First we stopped for a rest in Port Angeles for a beer and a rest before heading into the wilderness</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Getting this far was already a 5 hour flight, a stay in Seattle, taking a train to Tacoma, and then a 3 hour drive to this city, 
            with another one hour drive ahead to the trailhead, we needed a rest to make sure we were packed and fresh for whatever happens on the trails ahead.</p>
            <p>Is it bears? Probably.</p>
            <br>
            <img src= "images\3 trailhead.jpg" alt= "fresh start on the trail" style="width:50%">
            <figcaption><b>Fresh start on the Sol Duc - Left to Right, Adam, Micah, Heather, and me (also Micah)</b></figcaption>
            <p>I think maybe instead of just giving a linear recap of this hike, I should also say WHY I love this park before continuing.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>1. There's nothing quite as feeling connected to the world around me as being in wilderness</li>
              <li> 2. There is nothing as humbling as walking into a bear on the path, or realizing you have to crawl around a narrow path to make it and realizing you are at the mercy of the elements of this world.</li>
              <li> 3. It's easy to get lost in day to day life and forget how much beauty there is just outside of our doorstep and beyond our noses. 4. Our society tends to focus on the self, and there, along a mountain ridge, by a coast, or sitting under a night sky, there is no focus on the self (aside from how to make dinner)
            </li> <li>4. It's a ridiculously beautiful park, with everything from beaches to mountains and even glaciers</li>
         </ul>
         <br>
         <figure>
         <img src= "images\4 Woods.jpg" alt= "into the woods we go" style="width: 50%">
         <figcaption><b>Into the woods we go</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>There is an art to hiking, and that art is to let go and also not die.</p> <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\5 Heart Lake.jpg" alt="By Heart Lake" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>By Heart Lake</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Sometimes that means just to pace yourself, others it means to not hike too close to an edge, a bear, or just make sure you're filtering your water.</p> <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\6 Resting.jpg" alt="Taking a rest" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Taking in the view</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Views like this are worth going into the woods, even being exhausted and body vibrating from hiking nonstop with a 30 pound pack and a camera</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\7 Ridge.jpg" alt="Hiking up a ridge" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Hiking up a ridge</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>These are the easier parts of the trail. There may be a lot of elevation, but it's not climbing over falling rocks by a cliff edge.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\8 Lunch Lake Camp.jpg" alt="campsite by Lunch Lake" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Second night campsite by Lunch Lake, making dinner</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Aside from bears roaming around this lake, there were also a lot of mosquitos.</p>
         <br>

            <figcaption><b>Sunset at Lunch Lake</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>There is nothing like disconnecting from city life, social media, and the day to day doldrum. Sitting by a lake in the mountains at sunset leaves a lot of space to wonder at the beauty of it all and just think.</p>
         <br>

         </figure>
         <p>I am not a morning person, but it's hard not to wake up at the break of dawn in the woods, especially when there is a beach to hike to that day. This leg we began at 5:30am. We had to just to be able to make it to our next camp by sundown, but also because to make it to that camp we had to hike through areas that are not flooded by tides for a couple of hours every day.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\11 Rock trail Adam DSCN0336.JPG" alt="Turbulant Trails" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Some trails aren't as easy, like crawling over these rocks at 6ish in the morning, photo courtesy of my friend Adam</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>But first before the beach, we had to crawl over these rocks on top of a mountain. Yes, this IS the trail. Doing this at 6:30am with no coffee doesn't really matter because clmibing over these rocks, and jumping from boulder to boulder with a 30 pound pack on will make you more alert than any cup of joe.</p>

            <figcaption><b>But often hard work is worth it, for morning views like these. Photo courtesy of my friend Micah</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>There are moments of solace even in hard work, where being able to stop and appreciate the world around me makes me appreciate just to be here.</p>
         <br>

            <figcaption><b>A place to reflect at deer lake.</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>I stopped here for a snack on the hike out, it was probably 9am by this point and the views were still great.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\14 Bear on Trail.jpg" alt="Bear along the trail" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Sometimes you walk around a bend and there is a bear. This one was about 15 feet away from me, the second of three we saw within three days</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Walking around a mountainous path, with nowhere to go but back or forward I walked right into this bear on the path. We looked at each other, and I realized I just had to wait it out. After about 20 minutes of just sitting here and the bear showed no signs of moving, I had to start yelling because otherwise I would have been here for who knows how long. The bear ran up the hill, and I continued on hiking.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>Out Of The Woods and To the Beach</h2> <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\15 Forest to Ocean.jpg" alt="The woods to the ocean" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>After a half day hike out, then a two and half hour drive to the coast, and another two hours into the woods, we made it to the ocean</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>there are moments in hiking where you reach a state of zen. Through tiredness, being sore in all the places, seeing so many beautiful sights and then moments of accomplishment when hiking out of the woods into views like this. It doesn't matter if you're tired, or sore or hungry, you just reach a point of moving forward.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\16 Heather Climb Down.jpg" alt="Climbing down" width= "" height= "580">
            <figcaption><b>There is still a lot of climbing and hiking to do around the beach to get to our camp</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Hiking along a beach in a tidal zone also means a lot of climbing, so if a point is under water, you have to go up and through the woods and over. Sore hands, bloody shins, evenn if you want to get somewhere you have to take your time and stay safe. Sometimes that means climbing down slowly. This was actually a pretty long steep climb, even if it doesn't look too bad in the photo.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\17 Beach Hike in.jpg" alt="Evening ocean views" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>But hiking in near dark in the woods affords beautiful evening views along the coast</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>We made it back out to the beach, but still had another hour to go before reaching camp. That means climbing and hiking through woods in near dark. No matter, I don't know if I will ever be here again so the best time to take a picture is now.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\18 Camp sunset.jpg" alt="Beach Camp" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Exhausted, we made it to our beach camp, we had been hiking since 5:30am, now time for dinner</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>We made it to our camp and set up in the dark, found beach wood and set a fire. Ready for some dinner, some stargazing and mostly some sleep.</p>
         <p>We decided the next morning that instead of hiking out and spending the day trekking to our next camp, we would stay and enjoy the beach.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\19 Otters by Micah.jpg" alt="Sea Otters" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Sea otters by our camp early morning, photo courtesy of my friend Micah</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>One thing about being out in the wilderness is there is so much life. At breakfast, a family a sea otters ran by our camp. Apparently their home was in our water source. The next best water source we found later that day was about a mile away, a little water fall on the side of a bluff.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\20 Low Tide Morning.jpg" alt="Low Tide" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Low tide, so let's go explore tidal pools!</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>On the beach, there are a couple of times a day for an hour or two where the water is low enough to walk out into tidal pools. That also means if you hike down the beach, you have to get back soon enough or get stuck on the other side.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\21 Low Tide Exploring.jpg" alt="Hiking on tidal pools" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Slippery exploring on tidal pools, so much life!</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Super slippery rocks, trying not to fall, but also exhilarated at seeing sea life in these tidal pools. Nobody around but us, sea anenomes and starfish.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\22 Hand Anenome.jpg" alt="anenome shadows" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Sea anenomes, starfish, little fish, all kinds of things we find in the tidal pools</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\23 Sea Deer.jpg" alt="Sea Deer" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Including...Sea Deer?</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>I expected sea life, but i didn't know that deer come out to graze in the tidal pools. They munch of seaweed and little sea creatures. This deer got about 5 feet away from me. It rained and the deer kept grazing. We stood in the rain watching it.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\24 Beach Running.jpg" alt="Beach running" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>When you find out hiking in sandals = bloody toes, but worth it for the exploring</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Later, we grabbed our packs to go hike to some other tidal pools and find a better water source than a rusty brown stream that had sea otters in it. This was Heather's first time being at the ocean in the Pacific NorthWest, so of course she had to run in it.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\25 Log Lazing.jpg" alt="Relaxing by the beach" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>The afternoon was sunny and warm, the trees carved out by the sea make great lounging chairs</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Apparently along the coast here the mornings are cloudy and rainy, but the afternoons are sunny and warm. The ocean carves trees out with water, which is a reminder of how powerful it is, but it also makes calm spaces for sitting and enjoying it's beauty. It is also high tide right now so we can't really hike anywhere, so we lunch and nap and get sunburnt</p>
         <br>
         <figure>

            <figcaption><b>The evening brings great views like these</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>A low tide again means I can grab my camera and go photograph the sunset with the tidal pools. There is no terror like the thought of falling into a pool with a camera, but the risk for capturing this memory is worth it.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\27 Micah Eating by Adam.JPG" alt="Sunburned and hungry" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Me after being sunburned and excited for a rehydrated dinner</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>Starving and sunburnt, we make dinner and try to keep sand out of our food, but of course sand makes it's way into everything.</p>
         <br>
         <figure>
            <img src= "images\28 beach fire.jpg" alt="Beach Campfire" style="width: 50%">
            <figcaption><b>Campfire after dinner, instead of hiking through, we decided to stay the next day too.</b></figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>We had originally planned to hike through, but this extra time to enjoy a fire under the stars at the break of sunset is what we were here for, and we reflected on the last few days. We were glad we stayed to enjoy where we were instead of push ourselves more. Nobody was camping here anyways, and we were exhausted when we got here. Also, when we were driving into the park I got a call from the ranger warning me the second leg of this hike was in really bad condition and I would likely need a machete to get through the undergrowth. We didn't bring one. If there is one thing that I know, it is to know when to take a break when the world gives you the opportunity, and to stop, appreciate where you are - and if you're lucky, that break also happens to be on a beach in the middle of the wilderness.</p>
